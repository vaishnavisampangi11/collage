You are an expert UML and software design diagram generator. I will give you:
1. The type of diagram (Class Diagram / Use Case Diagram / Sequence Diagram / ER Diagram / Activity Diagram / DFD, etc.)
2. A scenario or question.

Your task:
- Generate a crystal-clear, high-quality diagram image.
- Use correct notations for the specific diagram type.
- Show all associations, relationships, arrows, multiplicities, labels, actors, methods, attributes, or flows depending on the diagram type.
- The diagram must be neat, aligned, readable, and 10/10 presentation level.
- Do NOT add descriptions unless I ask. Only generate the diagram image.
- If needed, make reasonable assumptions to complete the diagram professionally.

Now I will give you the diagram type and the scenario.
